Welcome to the VENITH NET HQ operating on the planet Kepler-22B!

We're a development group focusing on Linux, the development of VENITH NET, and much more. We have done quite a bit of things over the years. So sit back, and relax. We're a chill community.

We also hope you can all stick around for the exciting future of the inclusive scene.
